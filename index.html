        <h3>Addendum: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. For this Mid-Term-Project I choosen a Mountain Adventures Game.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. On its initial page we get the entire description of the Mountain Adventure Games and there is a button called a "Start Game".
          </li>
          <li>
            3. After clicking that "Start Game" button we will get a dialog box that showing the game console in that there is a drop-down list where you can select what ever game you want, In addition to that there is "End Game" button by clicking that you will exit from the game and you can see the initial web page as when you are starting the Game.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Then, there are creative choices in form of multiple options as drop-down list like "Rock Climbing", "Mountain Biking", "Snowboarding" and "Paragliding" as shown once you click then you will get the related story on the left side  with an image displaying on its right side, and also the entire page will get updated with the related game option.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Next, there is a "Read More" button, by clicking that you will get an extra hidden information and after that you can see the "Read Less" by clicking that you will see the information as in initial form as you seen before clicking the "Read More" button.
          </li>
          <li>
            6. There is one difficulty that at initial stage after selecting the option from the drop down list there is an problem I faced with loading image and story of that game due to backend connectivity. 
          </li>
          <li>
            7. That issues has resolved by selecting another option and returing back to the orginal option you can see the actual result.
          </li>
        </ul>
